    "Homogeneity and completeness are measured with a score between 1 and 0, with one being more desirable. Our model would achieve homogeneity if each of our clusters only contained data points from 1 individual genre, similarly it would achieve completeness if all members of a genre were within the same cluster for all clusters. The v-measure provides an average of the 2. We can see from our results that our clusters are neither homogenous nor complete."
